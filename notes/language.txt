*language system*

The player can learn languages. It would be percentage based, zero to 100%. When talking
to someone who doesn't speak the same language, replace certain words with garbled
depending on how well the language is known/unknown. Could use markov chains to create
words of similar size, and give languages a coherent feel. Words should be different
each playthrough, to discourage memorization.

The more exposed you are to a language, the more you learn. Books could increase knowlede.

Punctuation is important, and facial expressions could be included to help infer when
the language is not known.
