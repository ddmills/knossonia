DEFENSE
Dodge Value (DV) - decrease likelyhood to hit   [Finesse]
Armor Value (AV) - compared against penetration [Strength]
Health      (HP) - pool of hit points           [Athleticism]

OFFENSE
Penetration (PV) - compared against armor       [From weapon]
Accuracy    (AC) - increase likelyhood to hit   [From weapon]
Flat Damage (DM) - damage dice roll             [From weapon]

Dodge  <vs> Accuracy
Armor  <vs> Penetration
Health <vs> Damage

DV = [d12 + FIN + DodgeAbility]
AC = [d12 + FIN + AccuracyAbility]

AV = [d12 + STR + ArmorAbility]
PV = [d12 + STR + PenetrationAbility]

Defensive Values
- Dodge Value DV = Compared against accuracy for to-hit (FNS)
- Armor Value AV = Soaks damage taken (STR)
- Health HP = Health pool (ATH)
- Resistences

- Penetration Value (PV) - Ignores armor
- Accuracy (AC) - Compared against DV to see if hit
- Damage types

When EntityA melee attacks EntityB with Weapon:

    **Will EntityA hit EntityB?**

    Dodge Value - Accuracy
    AC   = (1d20 + EntityA.accuracy + Weapon.accuracyMod)
    DV   = (1d20 + EntityB.dodgeAbility)
    HIT  = DV < AC

    **How much damage will it do?**

    DMG    = weapon.primaryStatMod + weapon die + weapon.abilityMod = Weapon.rollDamage
    Armor  = AV * (1 - PV)
    HP     = HP - Max(DMG - Armor, 0)
