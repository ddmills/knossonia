# interior castle gen algorithm

Based off of a simple binary space partitioning algorithm, but to
account for corridors.


1. start with one big filled in room
2. choose a random direction (D)
3. choose a random point along the direction in the room
    - if the room top or bottom do not touch an exterior edge, favor a cut
      that is 1-width wide (creating a corridor). mark the room as a
      "corridor" room
    - include "max corridor" and "min corridor" counts
4. continue subdividing until sufficiently cut up
5. connect the BSP leaf notes with a door or destroy the wall completely
    - do not destroy wall completely if one of the rooms is a "corridor" room
6. for each corridor room
    - add doors on both ends
7. do this once for each "floor"
8. for each floor - 1, find staircase locations that overlap between floor and floor+1
