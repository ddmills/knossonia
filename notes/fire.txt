Fire properties
 - spreadability
 - combustability
 - heat
 - fuel
 - flash point
 - on burnt out

- % chance the fire will die out
    - heat, life, fuel?
- % chance the fire will attempt to spread
    - heat, spreadability
- % chance the object will catch fire if exposed
    - heat, intensity (flash point)

%DIE = chance to die
%SPREAD = chance to cause spark
%CATCH = chance to catch if spark

- for every object on fire
    - INTENSITY = AVG(INTENSITY, NAT_INTENSITY)
    - SPARK = d100 < %SPREAD
    - for each combustible neighbor
        - neighbor.HEAT = AVG(HEAT, neighbor.HEAT)
        - if SPARK & d100 < %CATCH
            - set neighbor on fire
    - if d100 < %DIE
        - remove fire component
